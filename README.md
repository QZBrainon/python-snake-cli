# Python Snake CLI

A python CLI snake game developed with the built-in curses module in python.

This project was created as part of a series of projects aimed at practicing concepts that I had learned throughout my journey to become a developer

## How to play

If you already have python3 installed on your machine, simply clone the repo, install dependencies and cd into the src directory, then:

```python3 main.py```

The window size to play the game must have a certain heigth for the game to be playable, so please adjust the console window size before starting the game as it cannot be resized while the game is being played
